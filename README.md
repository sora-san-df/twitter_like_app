An app that is similar to twitter, but withouth all the bad stuff.

# What is this app about?

------------

This app was made while participating in a challenge made by platzi!

# Okay but, did you change something?

------------

actually, yes, this project was supposed to be a twitter clone, so you had to clone the interface and make it tweet capable.... well a tweet xD. The thing is that I couldn't attend that class, so I decided to invent my own twitter inspired application. the functionality still being the same tho. 
# What technologies did you use?
i use mainly react with javaScript, also started using vite js for the first time(and it is really useful!)besides that, didnt use anything else.
# What did you learn by doing this?
use what i knew about react to build something more "real" something that i didnt watch and followed in a tutorial, also i consumed my first API rest with react! (was a little bit complicated at first but i figure it out how to solve it ! ╰(*°▽°*)╯)also learned, of course, how to work with components in a modular way, and how work with the styles(used vanilla css) in each component.
# Okay, how does the app looks like?
